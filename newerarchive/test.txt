"new archive" still exists in the GitHub repo, so isn't being ignored as expected (although it is greyed out in Brackets...).
This file is in a folder with no spaces in the title to see if that makes a difference to how .gitignore works.

I have changed. I have CHANGED.

I've changed again, despite the new changes to .gitignore

yet another change, although gitignore now has an asterisk

OK, what if I name it specifically?

Now with the /?
